# Restaurant Management System (FullStack)

I built a full-stack Restaurant Management System using Node.js and Express, with MongoDB as the database and Handlebars for server-side templating. The project follows a clean MVC structure with separate controllers, routes, and models, along with a dedicated config/db.js for database connection. Sensitive data is managed securely using environment variables and .gitignore keeps private files out of source control. The application includes authentication with protected routes and session handling. Admin users have full access to manage restaurant operations, including creating, updating, and deleting menu items and handling customer orders. Regular logged-in users can browse menu cards, place orders, and view their order history, but cannot modify menu data. This project demonstrates backend functionality, database interaction, and dynamic server-rendered frontend views, all deployed and structured for real-world use.
